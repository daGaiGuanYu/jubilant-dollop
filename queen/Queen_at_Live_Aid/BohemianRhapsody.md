Mama, just killed a man.
Put a gun against his head.
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun.
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama ohhh.
Didn't mean to make you cry.
If I'm not back again this time tommorrow.
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come.
Sends shivers down my spine.
Body's aching all the time.
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go.
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama ohhh.
I don't wanna die.
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
